# Release Guide for Django Smart Ratelimit

## Quick Release Checklist

### 1. Pre-Release Preparation

- [ ] Run all tests: `make ci-check`
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new version entry (add after `## [Unreleased]`)
- [ ] Update `README.md` if needed
- [ ] Commit changelog changes: `git commit -am "docs: Update CHANGELOG for vX.Y.Z"`
- [ ] Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
- [ ] Ensure working tree is clean and you're on `main` branch

### 2. Automated Release (Recommended)

Use the Makefile for a fully automated release:

```bash
# Single command to:
# - Update version in all files
# - Commit version bump
# - Push commit to GitHub
# - Create and push tag (triggers PyPI publish)
make release VERSION=0.8.9
```

The `make release` command will:

1. ‚úÖ Verify you're on main branch with clean working tree
2. üìù Update version in `__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.
3. üì¶ Commit the version bump
4. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Push commit to `origin/main`
5. üè∑Ô∏è Create and push tag `vX.Y.Z`
6. üöÄ GitHub Actions automatically publishes to PyPI (triggered by tag)

### 3. What Happens Automatically

Once the tag is pushed, GitHub Actions will:

- Build the package
- Check package integrity
- Publish to PyPI using `PYPI_API_TOKEN`

No manual PyPI interaction needed! ‚ú®

### 4. Manual Publishing (Emergency Only)

If automation fails and you need to publish manually:

```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/

# Build package
python3 -m build

# Check package
python3 -m twine check dist/*

# Upload to PyPI
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Version Management

### Automated Version Update (Recommended)

The `make release VERSION=X.Y.Z` command automatically updates version in:

- `django_smart_ratelimit/__init__.py`
- `examples/integrations/drf_integration/__init__.py`
- `pyproject.toml`

You only need to manually update `CHANGELOG.md` before running the release command.

### Manual Version Update (If Needed)

If you need to update version manually for any reason:

Edit `django_smart_ratelimit/__init__.py`:

```python
__version__ = "0.8.9"  # Update this
```

Edit `examples/integrations/drf_integration/__init__.py`:

```python
__version__ = "0.8.9"  # Keep in sync
```

Edit `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
current_version = "0.8.9"  # Keep in sync
```

### Update Changelog (Always Manual)

Edit `CHANGELOG.md` - Add new version entry after `## [Unreleased]`:

```markdown
## [0.8.9] - 2025-10-06
